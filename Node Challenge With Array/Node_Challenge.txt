Problem:
--------

Build a CRUD Api for Product using NodeJS / Express . Product model contains 3 fields (id, title and description) 
API endpoints:

Duration: 4 hr

GET /api/products => Get ALL products
GET /api/products/1 => Get product detail
POST /api/products => Create new product
PUT /api/products/1 => Update Product
DELETE /api/products/1 => Delete product from array

Note: Maintain your Product list in Array. Not looking any database integration here
Test your API using Postman
